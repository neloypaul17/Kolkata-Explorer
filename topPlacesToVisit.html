        <p class="content"><img src="images\DT.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: left">
Dakshineshwar Kali Temple is a Hindu temple located on the eastern banks of the Hooghly River in a small town in the north of Kolkata named Dakshineshwar. The beauty and charm of Dakshineswar Kali Temple is known to be such that a trip to Kolkata is often said to be incomplete without a visit to this temple.
Profoundly affected by the dream, Rani immediately looked for and purchased a 30,000-acre plot in the village of Dakhineswar. The large temple complex was built between 1847 and 1855. The 20-acre (81,000 m2) plot was bought from an Englishman, Jake Hastie, and was then popularly known as Saheban Bagicha.
Partly old Muslim burial ground shaped like a tortoise, considered befitting for the worship of Shakti according to Tantra traditions, it took eight years and nine hundred thousand rupees to complete the construction. The idol of Goddess Kali was installed on the Snana Yatra day on 31 May 1855 amid festivities
 at the temple formerly known as Sri Sri Jagadishwari Kali, with Ramkumar Chhattopadhyay as the head priest.

        <p class="content"><img src="images\Howrah B.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: right">
          The Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in 1943, the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at the same location linking the two cities of Howrah and Kolkata.Eventually a contract was
          signed with Sir Bradford Leslie to construct a pontoon bridge. Different parts of the bridge were constructed in England and shipped to Calcutta, where they were assembled. The assembling period was fraught with problems. The bridge was considerably damaged by the great cyclone on 20 March 1874.
          A steamer named Egeria broke from her moorings and collided head-on with the bridge, sinking three pontoons and damaging nearly 200 feet of the bridge.[8] The bridge was complete in 1874,[9] at a total cost of ₹2.2 million,[17] and opened to traffic on 17 October of that year.The bridge was then 1528 ft
          long and 62 ft wide, with 7-foot wide pavements on either side.

        <p class="content"><img src="images/PGhat.jpg" alt="alt text" style="float: left">
            Prinsep Ghat, located on the banks of River Hooghly, is a majestic structure famous for its Greek/ Gothic inlays. The beauty of Princep Ghat draws architecture and history buffs in large numbers, but even locals visit to absorb the regal vibe of the attraction.Prinsep Ghat is one of the oldest recreational
            spots of Kolkata.[4] People visit it in the evenings on weekends to go boating on the river, stroll along the bank and purchase food from stalls there. A 2-kilometre (1.2 mi) stretch of the beautified riverfront from Prinsep Ghat to Babughat (Baje Kadamtala Ghat) was inaugurated on 24 May 2012. It has illuminated
            and landscaped gardens and pathways, fountains and renovated ghats. One of the songs in the Bollywood film Parineeta was shot here on the ghats.The meandering Hooghly river which flows perennially through the heart of Kolkata has not only facilitated efficient water transport, but the embankments or Ghats that have
            been built at strategic locations along the river's flow has provided the people of Kolkata with vantage points to appreciate the beauty of this holy river.
